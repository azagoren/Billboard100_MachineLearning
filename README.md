# Billboard 100 Machine Learning Project 

## Project Overview

When given the opportunity to explore machine learning techniques on a topic of our choice, our team decided upon predicting music popularity. While we all enjoy exploring social issues through data research, we're not afraid to embrace a more light-hearted topic and just have fun with the data. With the rise of streaming platforms fundamentally altering music distribution, we were curious to predict what factors to play an important role in predicting a song's popularity. Using the Million Song Dataset available here (insert link), and the Billboard 100 Weekly Charts Dataset available on data.world (insert link) we developed classifying models predicting whether or not a song would make the Billboard Top 100 and examining which variables played important roles in determining this outcome. 

## Machine Learning Techniques 

We have listed below the four machine learning techniques implemented within this study: 
*(For more information regarding these techniques, please see our final report)*

* **Classification Tree**:

While our classification tree was able to correctly predict when a song would not make the charts 97.7% of the time, its low sensitivity values (0.0333) were a cause for concern. Since our project was more interested in prediciting when a song would be successful, we chose to pursue other models in hopes that they would yield better sensitivity results. 

* **Random Forest**:
The random forest most yielded slighly improved 

* **Lasso Regression**: 

* **Random Forest using SMOTE sampling**:
